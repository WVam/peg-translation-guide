# Translator's Guide to Project: Eden's Garden
A list of tools and tutorials to make translations of the Project: Eden's Garden Prologue.
## Notes
This guide is only meant for languages that:
1. Are not right-to-left languages (e.g. Hebrew)
2. Do not make a prominent use of ligatures (e.g. Arabic)
If your language is one of these, then it will be almost impossible to translate the game in your language

## Getting started
In order to implement your translation into the game, you will need:
* [UABEA v6](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA/releases/tag/v6) (which will be henceforth referred to as "UABEA")
* [UABEA v5](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA/releases/tag/v5)
* [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases/tag/v6.1.8)
