# Translator's Guide to Project: Eden's Garden
A list of tools and tutorials to make translations of the Project: Eden's Garden Prologue.
## Notes
This guide is meant for Windows 10 users. If you are on Linux, you should still be able to work on the game, but you will be unable to run it.

This guide is only meant for languages that:
1. Are not right-to-left languages (e.g. Hebrew)
2. Do not make a prominent use of ligatures (e.g. Arabic)

If your language is one of these, then it will be almost impossible to translate the game in your language.

## Getting started
In order to implement your translation into the game, you will need:
* [UABEA v6](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA/releases/tag/v6)
* [UABEA v5](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA/releases/tag/v5)
* [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases/tag/v6.1.8)

### Install applications
To install these programs, follow the links above and downoad the correct `.zip` file based on your operating system. Then, ([unzip the `.zip` file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc) in a new folder \(create a new folder for each `.zip` file\).

### Install libraries and frameworks
In order to use UABEA, you will need to download the [.NET Runtime 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) and the [VS C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). You will download two installers: run them and follow the instructions in order to install the software. Note that you might need administrator privileges in order to do this.
