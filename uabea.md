# How to use UABEA

## What is UABEA
UABEA (short for Unity Asset Bundle Editor Avalonia) is a tool that can extract and import assets. It's a fork of (i.e. it's based on the code from) UABE (Unity Asset Bundle Editor). However, we will not be using this as the safety system on your computer will usually prevent you from downloading it.

UABEA is the main tool you will be using in order to mod Project: Eden's Garden. Make sure you understand how to use ot before embarking on this journey.

You will be downloading two versions of UABEA: v6 and v5. While you will be mainly using v6, assets containing Non-Stop Debates cannot be opened in that version and as such you will be using UABEA v5 in order to edit them.

## Installing and running UABEA
Note: these instructions are valid for both UABEA v6 and v5.

If you have followed the link [on the main page](README.md), you have already downloaded a zip file. Extract this zip file in a folder of your liking \(make sure it's different for v6 and v5\). Go to the place where you have extracted it and look for a `UABEAvalonia.exe` file. Run that file to open UABEA.
