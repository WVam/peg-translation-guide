# How to use UABEA

## What is UABEA
UABEA (short for Unity Asset Bundle Editor Avalonia) is a tool that can extract and import assets. It's a fork of (i.e. it's based on the code from) UABE (Unity Asset Bundle Editor). However, we will not be using this as the security system on your computer will usually prevent you from downloading it.

UABEA is the main tool you will be using in order to mod Project: Eden's Garden. Make sure you understand how to use ot before embarking on this journey.

## Installing and running UABEA
If you have followed the link [on the main page](README.md), you have already downloaded a zip file. Extract this zip file in a folder of your liking. Go to the place where you have extracted it and look for a `UABEAvalonia.exe` file. Run that file to open UABEA.
