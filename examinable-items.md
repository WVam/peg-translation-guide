This is how you edit the name 
## Normal Items
## Doors
The names that appear when selecting doors (including Caraâ€™s body) are stored separately. In fact, there are two ways the names of doors could be stored.
Some are in the `Door` assets which are found in the `level<n>` file.

Some are in the `GYM_<room name>` files.

One is in a `SubAreaManager` asset. It's a bit of a mess.
